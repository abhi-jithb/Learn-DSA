Explanation of Functions:
enqueue(int value): Adds an element to the queue if itâ€™s not full. If the queue is empty (i.e., front == -1), it initializes the front to 0.
dequeue(): Removes the front element from the queue and shifts the front pointer. If the queue is empty, it prints an error message.
peek(): Displays the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
displayQueue(): Displays all the elements in the queue from front to rear.
Main Loop: Continuously prompts the user to choose between enqueueing, dequeueing, checking the front element, displaying the queue, or exiting.


Example Output:
Choose an option:
1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Show Front (Peek)

Enqueued 10 into the queue

Choose an option:
1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Show Front (Peek)
4. Display Queue
5. Exit

Choose an option:
1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Show Front (Peek)
4. Display Queue
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 2
Dequeued 10 from the queue

Choose an option:
1. Enqueue
2. Dequeue
3. Show Front (Peek)
4. Display Queue
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 4
Queue: 20   

Real-World Analogy:
Imagine a line of people waiting to buy tickets at a counter. 
The first person in line (front of the queue) will be served first. 
When new people arrive, they go to the end of the line (rear of the queue).
As people are served (dequeued), the front of the line moves forward. 
The process of adding and removing people from the queue follows this FIFO (First In, First Out) rule.
